                <p>I am a passionate self-learner from Florida, who made the bold transition from customer service to the world of technology - and it has been an exciting journey!</p>
                <p>My creativity and natural problem-solving abilities have fueled my development skills.</p>
                <p>I am consistently motivated by the progress I have made.</p>
                <p>In early 2024, I embarked on earning certifications in Software Development, diving deep into the field, and haven't looked back since!</p>
                <p>With my artistic background as a tattoo artist, I bring a keen attention to detail to every project, blending both ingenuity and precision into my work.</p>
